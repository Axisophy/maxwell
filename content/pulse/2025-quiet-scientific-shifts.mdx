While the headlines chased AI announcements and political drama, science kept moving. Here are 10 signals from 2025 that mattered more than most people noticed.

## 1. Solar Cycle 25 Exceeded Predictions

The sun's current activity cycle, which began in December 2019, has consistently outperformed forecasts. By late 2025, sunspot numbers had exceeded the predicted maximum — and the cycle isn't over yet.

This matters because solar activity directly affects Earth's space weather, satellite operations, and aurora visibility. The stronger-than-expected cycle has already produced several significant geomagnetic storms.

## 2. LIGO's Fourth Observing Run

The gravitational wave detectors completed their most sensitive observing run yet. While the final catalogue hasn't been published, preliminary alerts suggest dozens of new detections — black hole mergers, neutron star collisions, and possibly some events we don't yet understand.

## 3. The Ozone Layer's Quiet Recovery

It's working. The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, continues to do its job. The ozone hole over Antarctica reached its smallest extent in decades during 2025. This is what successful global environmental policy looks like — and almost nobody is paying attention.

## 4. Antarctic Ice Sheet Dynamics

New satellite data revealed surprising complexity in how the Antarctic ice sheet responds to warming. Some glaciers are accelerating their flow toward the sea, while others have stabilised. The picture is more nuanced than simple collapse narratives suggest.

## 5. The Neutrino Background

IceCube Neutrino Observatory continued mapping the high-energy universe. Neutrinos from distant blazars, supermassive black holes, and as-yet-unidentified sources are painting a new picture of the cosmos — one invisible to light-based telescopes.

## 6. JWST's Steady Output

James Webb Space Telescope moved past the "wow factor" phase into systematic science. Early universe observations are challenging models of galaxy formation, while exoplanet atmosphere studies are becoming routine.

## 7. Fusion Progress

Both government and private fusion projects hit technical milestones. While commercial power remains distant, the engineering problems are being solved one by one. The physics works; now it's about scale and economics.

## 8. Biodiversity Monitoring at Scale

Satellite and acoustic monitoring systems now track ecosystems in near-real-time. We're building a nervous system for the biosphere — the first step toward managing what we can actually measure.

## 9. Battery Chemistry Evolution

Beyond lithium-ion, alternative battery chemistries made commercial progress. Sodium-ion, solid-state, and iron-air technologies moved from lab to pilot production. The energy transition's storage problem is being solved on multiple fronts.

## 10. Quiet Earthquake Science

Slow slip events, silent earthquakes that release strain over days rather than seconds, are being mapped with increasing precision. Understanding these may help predict which faults are primed for major ruptures.

These aren't breakthrough announcements. They're the steady accumulation of knowledge that actually changes our understanding and capability. The work continues.
