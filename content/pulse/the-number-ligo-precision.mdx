The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) can detect changes in distance of approximately 10⁻¹⁹ metres — about one ten-thousandth the width of a proton.

To achieve this, LIGO uses 4-kilometre laser arms and measures interference patterns to extraordinary precision. When a gravitational wave passes through Earth, it stretches space in one direction while compressing it in another. LIGO sees this as a shift in the interference pattern.

This is the most precise measurement humanity has ever achieved.
