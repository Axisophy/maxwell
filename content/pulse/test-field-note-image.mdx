The sun's been busy this week. Active region AR3901 rotated into view on Tuesday, and by Thursday it had produced two M-class flares in quick succession.

## What we're seeing

The Solar Dynamics Observatory captures the sun in multiple wavelengths simultaneously. Each reveals different temperature layers of the solar atmosphere.

At 171 Ångströms, we see plasma at around 600,000 Kelvin - the quiet corona, loops of magnetic field lines made visible by trapped gas.

At 304 Ångströms, we're looking at cooler material - around 50,000 Kelvin - the chromosphere and transition region where flares first become visible.

## Why it matters

Solar Cycle 25 is approaching its predicted maximum. Activity has been running consistently above forecast since late 2024. This week's flares weren't exceptional - M-class events happen regularly near solar maximum - but the cumulative pattern suggests we're entering the most active phase.

For aurora watchers, the next few months offer the best odds of visible displays at mid-latitudes since 2003.
