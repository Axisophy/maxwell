The sun operates on an approximately 11-year cycle of activity, moving from solar minimum (few sunspots, quiet conditions) to solar maximum (many sunspots, frequent flares and coronal mass ejections).

Solar Cycle 25 began in December 2019 and has been climbing steadily since. What's notable about this cycle is that it has consistently exceeded predictions — NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center initially forecast a relatively weak maximum, but observed sunspot numbers have been running well above the prediction curve.

## Why This Matters

Solar activity directly affects:

- **Aurora visibility** — Higher activity means more frequent and more southerly aurora displays
- **Satellite operations** — Increased drag on low-Earth orbit satellites during high activity
- **Radio communications** — Solar flares can disrupt HF radio propagation
- **Power grids** — Severe geomagnetic storms can induce currents in long conductors

## What to Watch

The Kp index, which measures geomagnetic activity, is the quickest indicator of current conditions. Values of 5 or above indicate storm conditions; Kp 7+ can produce aurora visible from the UK.

Solar maximum is expected sometime in late 2025 or early 2026, though the exact timing won't be clear until the cycle is past its peak.
