Every year, science produces headlines. Breakthrough drugs, space launches, Nobel prizes. These get attention because they're easy to announce: something happened, here's what it means.

But the shifts that matter most are often quieter. A trend that crossed a threshold. A technique that became routine. A consensus that formed without fanfare.

This is MXWLL's attempt to identify ten such shifts from 2025 - not predictions, but observations about what changed while we weren't paying attention.

## 1. Solar Cycle 25 exceeded all forecasts

The official prediction from NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center called for a weak cycle, peaking around 2025 with a smoothed sunspot number of 115.

By December 2025, the smoothed sunspot number had already reached 180 and was still climbing. The cycle is now tracking closer to the stronger cycles of the late 20th century.

This matters because solar activity drives space weather - geomagnetic storms, satellite drag, radio blackouts, and aurora visibility. A stronger cycle means more of all of these.

## 2. Fusion experiments crossed net energy (again)

The National Ignition Facility's December 2022 result - more energy out than in - was a landmark. But it was a single shot, not a sustained reaction, and the energy accounting excluded the lasers' own power consumption.

In 2025, multiple facilities demonstrated repeatable fusion gain. The goalposts keep moving, but the trajectory is now unmistakable.

## 3. AI weather forecasting became operational

GraphCast, Pangu-Weather, and their successors moved from research demonstrations to operational deployment. Several national weather services now run AI models alongside traditional numerical weather prediction.

The AI models are faster and cheaper. On many metrics, they're also more accurate. The implications for computational infrastructure - and for our understanding of what "weather prediction" means - are still unfolding.
