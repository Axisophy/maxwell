At 4,207 metres, the summit of Mauna Kea sits above 40% of Earth's atmosphere. The air is thin, dry, and remarkably stable - ideal conditions for astronomical observation.

Thirteen telescopes share the summit, operated by institutions from eleven countries. On a clear night, the Milky Way is bright enough to cast shadows.

This image shows the Subaru Telescope (Japan) and the twin Keck domes (USA) as the sun sets behind them. Within an hour, the domes will open and the night's observations will begin.
