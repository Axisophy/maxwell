When two black holes spiral into each other a billion light-years away, the ripple in spacetime that reaches Earth is almost incomprehensibly small.

LIGO's interferometers can detect a change in arm length of about 10⁻¹⁹ metres - roughly one ten-thousandth of the diameter of a proton.

To achieve this, the mirrors must be isolated from every possible source of vibration: seismic noise, thermal fluctuations, even the quantum uncertainty of light itself.

The number above represents what seemed impossible when LIGO was first proposed in the 1980s. It took thirty years of engineering to make it routine.
