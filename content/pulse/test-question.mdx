We expected to see neutrinos from the centre of the galaxy - that's where all the action is. Supermassive black hole, dense stellar populations, lots of high-energy processes.

Instead, the most energetic neutrino we've ever detected came from a direction with nothing obvious in it. No known gamma-ray source, no active galaxy, no supernova remnant.

It took two years of follow-up observations to identify the source: a blazar - an active galaxy with a jet pointed almost directly at Earth - that happened to be in a quiet phase when we first looked.

Sometimes the sky surprises you by being empty. And sometimes what looks empty is just waiting to reveal itself.
