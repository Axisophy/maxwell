A coronal mass ejection that left the sun on January 1st arrived at Earth overnight, triggering a G2-class geomagnetic storm.

The Kp index peaked at 6 around 03:00 UTC. Aurora was visible from Scotland, northern England, and parts of northern Germany. Conditions are expected to remain elevated through tonight.
